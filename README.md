# Amber Cai

My name is Amber. Welcome to my website. Here you will find information about me and the work I have done. 


**About Me**

My name is Amber Cai. Today, I am going to give you an outline of what I am like as a professional. I don’t allow myself to make mistakes, so what that means is that I try to make my work as well done as I can. I know not everything can be perfect as perfect can be, but I certainly try my best. 
	I’ve been raised to do my very best in whatever I do, so you will be able to get that from me. I intend to do this right. If any mistake were to happen, I will do my best to fix it as soon as possible. This means that whatever project comes on, no matter how big it is, you will get my best and only my best. 
	I hope you know that I don’t joke around, as other people do. I take everything seriously, so I expect that from you as well. As I am going to put my best into projects, I likewise expect the same from you. 
	If you have any questions, you can always ask me and I will answer them to the best of my knowledge, I promise you. I won’t hide any information from you. I will have you know that I am new to this field, but I will do whatever it is I need to do in order to succeed. If you need any other help from me, all you need to do is ask and I will respond as soon as I can. 
	I graduated from Hammond High School and I studied at Howard Community College studying Audio, Visual, Media Production. I took classes in Principles of Media and Film Production, learning how to film all sorts of different camera angles. I don’t exactly remember all the classes I took, however, I did take Introduction to Dance as an Elective and Introduction to Electronic Media. As of right now, I am taking Media Career Development and Concept and Story Development. 
	I have garnered that I am good at Teaching. Although I have studied in an AVMP major, I am not good at it and rather, I am good at Education. I don’t yet have any certifications in the field as I have just recently switched majors last semester. I look forward to working with people in this field as this is my interest as well as Education. I have always had an interest in Media as much as I did in Education and have yearned for a way to pursue both at the same time, and now I believe I have a way to do so. I may not be good at conversations, but I am good at passing information on in the manner of teaching. 
	I have yet to gather any relevant experience as I have yet to find opportunities to get some. I hope some come my way in the near future. 
	

I am about completion and how to do it right, and to do it right is to follow the directions correctly which is what the people want me to do...and I do what is within my ability to do it right, like I said before.
